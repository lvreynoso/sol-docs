# Mercury

Mercury is a tiny rock, scalding hot, and the planet orbiting closest to the Sun.
Tectonically dead and completely lifeless, Mercury completes an orbit once every
88 days. Whatever atmosphere it might have had was long ago stripped away by the
powerful solar winds the planet experiences.
