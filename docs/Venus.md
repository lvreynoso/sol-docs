# Venus

Venus is the second planet from the Sun and boasts the hottest surface in the
Solar System. Thanks to a runaway greenhouse gas effect, Venus is wrapped in an
extremely thick and suffocating atmosphere. Surface temperatures can reach over
800 degrees celsius. Like Mercury, Venus has no moons.
